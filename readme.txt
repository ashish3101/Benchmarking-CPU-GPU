Codes:
benchmark1 -> benchmark1.cu   computes the square root of an array and stores the output in another array.

benchmark2 -> benchmark2.cu multiplies each element of an array with a constant number and saves the output in another array.

benchmark3 ->  benchmark3.cu is a brute force euclidian distance tranform.

benchmark4 ->  It computes the video rendering capabilities of CPU and GPU and report its observational data.

*.cu files are coded in CUDA programmming language. It requires CUDA sdk and can be executed on CUDA compatible hardware only.


Additional Data:

A separate study report has been written by us on "GPU implementation in Bitcoin Mining" ,which could not be included in the previously submitted project definition as this topic is relatively new  and has surfaced just a few weeks back.
